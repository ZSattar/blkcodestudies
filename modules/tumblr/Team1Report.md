* Barbara Fields wrote: Ideology is the "vocabulary of day-to-day existence, through which people make rough sense of the social reality that they live and create from day to day." What links can you make between ideology, coding and slavery using #12YearsASlave and #UndergroundWGN?
* Identify "digital resonances" in 12 Years a Slave and UndergroundWGN - things that would only make sense in the digital era now, but that we can also read as being digital in that moment.
* What is the salience of the past (the history of slavery) in this digital moment?
